## About

<font size=4>

**S2648.txt**: forward mutations in S5296, and it includes 2,648 non-redundant unique single-point mutations from 131 globular proteins using selected single one experimental structure for a protein.

**RS2297.txt**: the subset of S2648 using all the other mapped redundant experimental structures.

**MS2297.txt**: the subset of S2648 using modeled structures built by Modeller software.

**Selected Structures.rar** contains the experimental structures used in S2648.

**Redundant Structures.rar** contains the experimental structures used in RS2297.

**Modeled Structures.rar** contains the modeled structures used in MS2297.

## Terms in the text files

<font size=4>

PDB Id: The PDB entry of protein in S2648.txt and RS2297.txt files, while in MS2297.txt it is composed of PDB ID and chain of target sequence and PDB ID and chain of template.

Mutated Chain: Protein chain with mutation.

Mutation_PDB: The mutation corresponding to the residue numbering found in the Protein Data Bank. The first character is one letter amino acid code for the wild-type residue, the second to penultimate characters indicate residue number, and the final character indicates the mutant amino acid.

UniProt: The UniProt ID of protein.

Mutation_UNP: The mutation corresponding to the residue numbering found in the protein sequence.

DDGexp: Experimental changes of unfolding Gibbs free energy upon mutations (in kcal/mol).

Location: Location of the mutated site in the protein structure (core or surface).

PremPS: Predicted changes of unfolding free energy upon mutations by PremPS (in kcal/mol). Positive and negative sign corresponds to destabilizing and stabilizing mutations, respectively. 

PremPS(CV4): "leave-one-protein-out" cross-validation results (in kcal/mol). 

Resolution: Resolution of structures (in Å).

Method: Experimental methods for resolving protein structures including X-ray ("x-ray"), NMR ("nmr") or Cryo-EM ("em").

Aggregate state: Multimeric state of a protein structure including monomer ("mo"), homomer ("ho") and heteromer ("he").

Weight: The molecular weight of a protein structure.

Sequence identity: Sequence identity between target sequences and templates.

RMSD: The root-mean-square deviation between coordinates of all Cα atoms of experimental and modeled structures (in Å).
