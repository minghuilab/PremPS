## About

<font size=4>

**S921.txt**: the combined independent test set contains 921 single mutations from 54 proteins.

**RS824.txt**: the subset of S921 using all the other mapped redundant experimental structures.

**MS824.txt**: the subset of S921 using modeled structures built by Modeller software.

**Selected Structures.rar** contains the experimental structures used in S921.

**Redundant Structures.rar** contains the experimental structures used in RS824.

**Modeled Structures.rar** contains the modeled structures used in MS824.

## Terms in the text files

<font size=4>

PDB Id: The PDB entry of protein.

Mutated Chain: Protein chain with mutation.

Mutation_PDB: The mutation corresponding to the residue numbering found in the Protein Data Bank. The first character is one letter amino acid code for the wild-type residue, the second to penultimate characters indicate residue number, and the final character indicates the mutant amino acid.

UniProt: The UniProt ID of protein.

Mutation_UNP: The mutation corresponding to the residue numbering found in the protein sequence.

DDGexp: Experimental changes of unfolding Gibbs free energy upon mutations (in kcal/mol).

Location: Location of the mutated site in the protein structure (core or surface).

PremPS: Predicted changes of unfolding free energy upon mutations by PremPS (in kcal/mol). Positive and negative sign corresponds to destabilizing and stabilizing mutations, respectively.

Resolution: Resolution of structures (in Å).

Method: Experimental methods for resolving protein structures including X-ray ("x-ray"), NMR ("nmr") or Cryo-EM ("em").

Aggregate state: Multimeric state of a protein structure including monomer ("mo"), homomer ("ho") and heteromer ("he").

Weight: The molecular weight of a protein structure.

Sequence identity: Sequence identity between target sequences and templates.

RMSD: The root-mean-square deviation between coordinates of all Cα atoms of experimental and modeled structures (in Å).

The rest of columns are stability changes predicted by methods of INPS3D, INPS, PoPMuSiC, mCSM	and FoldX, respectively (in kcal/mol).
